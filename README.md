Our aim is to develop a GIS-based web application for all govt schools in KP province. 

This application will list all the schools on an interactive map. The map will show administrative boundaries of all districts in KP. Clicking on a district polygon will show basic information about that district. The schools in a district will be shown by various markers depending on the school type and level. 

For each school, the application will show the following information:
School name, school code, school level, functioning status, village, post office, union council, tehsil, district, no. of students, no. of staff (teaching +_non-teaching), covered area, and school facilities like water, electricity etc.

This application will allow viewers to filter schools based on the following criteria:

District: View schools by one or more selected districts
Level: Primary, Middle, High, Higher Secondary
Status: Functional, Temporary closed
Location: Urban, Rural
Gender: Boys, Girls
Facilities: Water, Electricity, Boundary wall, Toilet
